# POST form Study case
Description
In this small project, **components** were used as the main structure. The project includes **page redirecting**, **form validations**, and a simple fetch to list products. Additionally, **server actions** were implemented to POST a new item to the API. Concepts of **caching** were also explored to enhance performance.
